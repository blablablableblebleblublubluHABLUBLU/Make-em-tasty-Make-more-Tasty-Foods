<img src="img/shoyu ramen.jpg" width="75% height="75%">
<br><i><h1 style="color: orange; background:white;">About Shoyu Ramen:</br></i></h1>
<h3>Shoyu Ramen (醤油ラーメン), also known as Tokyo ramen, It consists of a soy sauce flavor and a clear soup broth served with medium-thin curly noodles.The light but delicious soup stock is made from chicken bones/pork bones and occasionally kombu seaweed, dried anchovies, katsuobushi or knowkn as Bonito Flakes. This will not be a Shoyu Ramen without these simple toppings of chashu (a Japanese pork belly), pickled bamboo shoots, green onions, and some Nori seaweeds.</h3>

<p><h3>Shoyu Ramen is considered an old school classic in japan. In 1910 Shoyu Ramen was first introduced in Rairaiken in Asakusa, Tokyo. At that time, Shoyu Ramen was called the "Tokyo Ramen".</p>

<p>Out of all the dishes sold at Rairaiken, Shoyu Ramen was its best seller. Shoyu Ramen became the catalyst for the Ramen's popularity throughout Japan.<p></h3>

<br><i><h1 style="color: orange; background:white;">Ingredients:</br></i></h1>

<h3>>PORK LEG BONES-Among the pork bones, thigh bones and knuckles is the best to make a sweet, flavorful pork bone for ramen.</h3>

<p><h3>>PORK BELLY STRIPS (WITHOUT SKIND/RIND)-To make the chashu, we will be needing 2 long narrow pork belly strips measuring 1½ inches x 2 inches x 10 inches or 3.8 cm x 5cm x 25 cm.</p></h3>

<p><h3>>RENDERED CHICKEN FAT-The soup broth will taste even better after adding some chicken fat, so you better not forget this ingredient.</p></h3>

<p><h3>>AROMATICS: ONION, GARLIC, GINGER, AND TOKYO NEGI (LONG GREEN ONION)-This will help your ramen more flavorful and have a good aroma on it. if you cant find tokyo negi, you can use green onions/scallions as a susbtitution.</p></h3>

<P><h3>>SHOYU TARE (SAUCE)-You can make shoyu tare by mixing soy sauce, sake, mirin, and salt.</p></h3>

<p><h3>FRESH RAMEN NOODLES-Of course we will be needing some fresh ramen noodles. this wouldn't be a ramen without its signature noodles!</p></h3>

<p><h3>>RAMEN TOPPINGS-For toppings, we will be needing some green onions, menma (seasoned bamboo shoots) and Nori seaweeds.

<br><i><h1 style="color: orange; background:white;">Procedure:</br></i></h1>


<h3>1. Start by making the soup broth by boiling the pork leg bones, aromatics, and pork belly in the water for 2 hours.</h3>

<p><h3>2. Right before the 2 hour mark, take out some soup broth and combine it with soy sauce, sake, mirin, and salt in another pot to make a chashu sauce.</p></h3>

<p><h3>3. at the 2 hour mark, add the chicken fat and the green parts of the tokyo negi (long green onions) to a pot of the soup broth and cook for another hour.</p></h3>

<p><h3>4. After the 3 hours of boiling the soup broth, take out the pork belly, and continue boiling the other parts for the next 3 hours.</p><h3>

<p><h3>5. Add the cooked pork belly to the chashu sauce and braise for 2 hours.</p></h3>

<p><h3>6. After cooking for 2 hours, remove the chashu from the sauce and let it cool completely before putting it to the refrigerator. Save this chashu sauce for the ramen'shoyu tare.</p></h3>

<p><h3>7. After the 6 hours of boiling the soup broth, remove the remaining bones and aromatics, and the soup broth is now ready!</p></h3>

<p><h3>8. To serve this, slice the chilled chashu into thin slices and cook the ramen noodles. After that, add the shoyu tare, piping hot soup broth and ramen noodles to the bowl. Add the toppings (green onions, menma, and nori seaweed. you can also some boiled eggs if you want.) And now you're done! Your own Shoyu Ramen is now finished!
